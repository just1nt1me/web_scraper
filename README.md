# web_scraper
Web Scraper with Python and BS4

This is a personal project I worked on while searching for apartments in Tokyo.

oakhouse.py - The web scraper outputs the parsed contents into a text file.
email_vacancies.py - Connects to the SMTP server and emails the text file

I have not included the email_config.py file is not included for security reasons.
